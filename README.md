; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grZKMmyfxe8
; blueprint created by youtuber NiceDriving - share code 741 027 831
; You will need to use a different tune code to automate the blueprint than what is shown in his video. (146 394 983)
;

; before running this script get in the mosler and have the difficulty set. Run the blueprint manually so that
; it is the most recent blueprint in your history.  
; While in normal driving mode alt-tab to file explorer where this script is.  Double click on the script to run it.  As 
; soon as the script loads a tool tip will show by the cursor.  You now have 5 seconds to alt-tab back to the Forza screen.
; When you alt-tab back to forza the main menu will likely be showing.  Hit escape to get back to driving mode.
; now watch and wait.
; Within the 5 seconds the script will start controlling your computer and try to run the blueprint.
; Now leave the computer alone and watch it make money.  
; To exit the script hit alt-esc at any time.
;
; You may need to edit some of the sleep times in the script because your computer runs at a different speed than
; mine.  Start by adding 5000 (5 seconds) to the sleep times if the script doesn't work for you.  The most important time
; is after the start race button is clicked.  Use a stopwatch if you have to.  You will want to get this time very close.
; for my computer it takes 6 seconds from the time I click start to the time I see GO!  It doesn't have to be perfect but
; try to get close.
; ideally the script tool tip should say neutral just as the car hits the ramp.  If this happens this part of the sleep timers
; is set as well as can be.
